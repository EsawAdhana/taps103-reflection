            For this final assignment, I felt like I had to make something that was a little more visual/dynamic to express my experiences across this quarter. I separated this project into independent weeks, highlighting some of the games/concepts which I really remembered and enjoyed.<br /><br />
            Weeks 1 and 2 really challenged me to understand that I don't have to be "right" --- embracing the idea that there is no single best thing to say. Something beats nothing.<br />
            Week 3 really helped me nail down the idea of continuity --- heavy things should stay heavy, light things light. "Don't walk through the table."<br />
            Week 4's vigil was truly something else. Making something so impactful and memorable from literally *nothing* was inspirational and really brought our class together.<br />
            Weeks 5-8 really challenged me to hone in on my abilities to think quick on my feet and make a narrative that tells *A* story, not necessarily the one that's the funniest or most clever.<br />
            And then lastly, Sebastian's week 9 musical improv cameo, although I had hesitation at first, was incredibly fun, and it introduced an entirely new dimension to what improv can be.<br /><br />
            Ultimately, I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend my Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings! Thank you!
